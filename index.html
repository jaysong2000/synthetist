        From this, it is evident that although the two Wes Moores both got into trouble relating to drugs or fighting and whatnot when they were children, their reactions were much different from each other. The author, although not completely dropping their troublesome actions (as implied in the end of Chapter 4 where he goes back to "tagging"), at least felt some remorse for his actions, while that was not seen in the other Wes Moore. The author uses these subtle behavior differences to show that despite the similarities in the conditions the two Wes Moores faced, they will go on vastly different paths in the future. Another key difference between the two Wes Moores is the reaction from their mother. The author's mother is strict, and threatens Wes with military school after minor infractions such as low grades, while the other Wes Moore's mother do not act until Wes' actions are in front of her eyes - and she fails to listen to Tony, or discipline Wes the first time she realizes he smells like alcohol and marijuana. These differences prove to have a great impact on the personality of the two Wes Moores, as the author has a form of control over himself, while the other Wes Moore does not - contributing to their polar opposite futures.
